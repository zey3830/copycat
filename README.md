##### Reflection

The main purpose for me to do this project is to practice my skills of HTML and CSS that I have learned so far throughout this school year. There are multiple websites I can choose from to "copy", but I ended up deciding on the dashboard for pupilpath because I wanted to challenge myself and from the first look on the dashboard there seems to be something I am not familiar with. So throughout this process I went onto to google to research about the unfamiliar elements, for example tables. I learned that tables are similar to how lists work in HTML, where you have the main element called table and smaller element inside that big element labeled with tr. Inside that tr element there are other different elements which you will use with CSS to customize it. During this project I also learned how to better manage my time, setting up goals, and achieving the goals before the set deadline. All in all, I learned a lot during this project from learning new html elements to being able to better manage my time. As well as being able to practice the skills and things I have learned throughout the school year.
